I am an astrophysicist specializing in multi-messenger and high-energy astrophysics, focusing on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), kilonovae, and dark matter. My research utilizes observational data from cutting-edge instruments such as the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (Fermi) and VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) to investigate the physical processes driving astrophysical transients and to probe the nature of dark matter.

Currently, I serve as a Research Professor at Seoul National University, collaborating with leading experts to study the dynamics of compact binary mergers and search for dark matter annihilation signals. I earned my PhD in Physics from the University of Maryland under the mentorship of Dr. Julie McEnery, focusing on the temporal and spectral evolution of GRBs. I also hold dual bachelorâ€™s degrees in mechanical engineering and physics from Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea.

My work combines multiwavelength data analysis, simulations, and advanced statistical methods to uncover new insights into astrophysical phenomena. Through interdisciplinary research and international collaborations, I am dedicated to expanding our understanding of the universe.
