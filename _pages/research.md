## Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs):
* Study of temporal and spectral evolution of GRBs, including the analysis of high-energy components and afterglows​​.
* Examination of closure relations in GRB emissions, focusing on spectral and temporal indices and testing synchrotron emission models​​.
* Investigation of high-latitude emission effects during the prompt phase of GRBs and their spectral implications​.

## Kilonovae:
* Investigation of the ejecta properties in neutron star mergers, including the impact of ejecta mass, temperature, and velocity on kilonova spectra and light curves​​.
* Identification of key heavy elements (e.g., SrII, BaII) contributing to kilonova spectral features and their parameter space ("resonance islands")​.
* Development of models to explain the diversity of kilonova light curves and their connection to velocity and density profiles of ejecta​.

## Dark Matter (DM):
* Exploration of indirect detection methods for ultra heavy DM through γ-ray observations, targeting masses far beyond the conventional unitarity limit​​.
* Study of annihilation cross-section constraints using data from γ-ray observatories like VERITAS and implications for composite DM particle properties​.
